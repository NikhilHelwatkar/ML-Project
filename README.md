# ML-Project
This project builds and evaluates regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, comparing their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization for better model performance understanding.

# Machine Learning Model Comparison

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for comparing different regression models, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**, and **Random Forest Regressor**. The models are trained and evaluated on a dataset, and their performances are compared using key metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R² Score**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

## Project Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for training models and generating evaluation reports.
- **`results/`**: Output files like model comparison reports and plots.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages.

## Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python installed and use the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
