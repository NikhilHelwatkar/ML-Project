# Machine Learning Model Comparison

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for comparing different regression models, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regressor**, and **Random Forest Regressor**. The models are trained and evaluated on a dataset, and their performances are compared using key metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score**.

## Project Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for training models and generating evaluation reports.
- **`results/`**: Output files like model comparison reports and plots.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages.

## Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python installed and use the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
